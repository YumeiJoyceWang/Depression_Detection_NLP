### Depression Detection Using XLNet (NLP, Deep Learning)

# Kaggle | Python, PyTorch, XLNet

•	Built a transformer-based text-classification model using XLNet to detect depression indicators from user-generated text.  

•	Preprocessed and tolenized 10k+ sample, fine-tuned XLNet to reduce overfitting.

•	Achieved 97.78% test accuracy, outperforming baseline Transformer models.
